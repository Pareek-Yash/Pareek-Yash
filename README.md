Hi there evryone, I'm Yash Pareek, Machine Learning Engineer (self-Proclaimed =)) ),
DeepLearning enthusiast. I'm developing few cool projects over, which I know have been done earlier I know but still I feel it's not bad to do what has been done before YOURSELF.
</br></br>
I have always learned from open-source community and glad to give some back to the community, I would love any collaboration and would love to help with any sort of ML problems that I can.
</br></br>
